// Special thanks to Vali for figuring out this issue! :)
// The Vintage, Standard, and Future suits are all defined in separate part modules that are combined when KSP starts.
// The problem is that when Module Manager is used to add part modules to the kerbal, you'll get duplicates.
// To get around that problem, the WBIModuleKerbalEVAModules adds a custom LoadingSystem that adds any part modules defined by a
// KERBAL_EVA_MODULES node.
// This is the baseline file. For your mod, simply define another KERBAL_EVA_MODULES with one or more standard MODULE config nodes,
// and they'll be added to the kerbal.
KERBAL_EVA_MODULES

	// This is a helper module that hides and shows custom 3D meshes on a kerbal whenever cargo parts are placed in or removed from
	// the kerbal's inventory.
	MODULE

		name = WBIModuleWearablesController

		// When set to true, the kerbal's PAW gains a button to open the prop offsets window.
		// The window lets you position and rotate a cargo part's custom 3D mesh and see the updates in realtime
		// without the need to restart KSP.
		// Once you have the offsets, you can copy them to the clipboard and paste them into your part.

	// Overrides the kerbal's EVA parameters as specified by the carried cargo part's EVA_OVERRIDES node.
