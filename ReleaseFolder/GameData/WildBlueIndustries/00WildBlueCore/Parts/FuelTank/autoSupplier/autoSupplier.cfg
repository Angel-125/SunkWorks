Simply attach one of these to a resource tank, record the start of the supply run, fly the mission, and recored the end of the supply run. Note how many hours it took and set the delivery time. Finally, enable Periodic Transfers. Periodically, you'll receive the contents of the resource tank and they'll be distributed just like the FLP-1 Fuel Pump.
