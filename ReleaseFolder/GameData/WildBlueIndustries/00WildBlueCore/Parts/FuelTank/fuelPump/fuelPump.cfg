	description = #LOC_WILDBLUECORE_fuelPumpPartDesc // Tired of searching through a craft to find all its tanks and fill them? Then the FLP-1 "Deluge" Fuel Pump is for you! Simply attach the Deluge to any tank containing resources, select the desired pump rate, and turn it on. Once enabled, the tank's resources will automatically be distributed throughout the vessel based on the destination tank's Flow Priority. But wait, there's more! Want to pump resources to a nearby vessel without docking to it? Now you can! Just turn on the pump, set the Pump Mode to Remote, place another Deluge Fuel Pump on the nearby vessel, and turn it on.
