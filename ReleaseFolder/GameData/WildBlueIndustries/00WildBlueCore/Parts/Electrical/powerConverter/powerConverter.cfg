The Probodobodyne Power Converter enables ground-deployed portable generators such as the OX-Stat-PD Photovoltaic Panel to charge rovers and other vessels, or for said rovers and other vessels to power ground-deployed devices. Just be sure to deploy a Probodobodyne Experiment Control Station as well, or the Power Converter won't be able to interface with the generators.

		// In Breaking Ground Science, Power Unit is an integer, but resources like ElectricCharge use decimals.
		// The default is 0.25, so 1.0 EC = 4 PU.
		// This number was derived by comparing the size of the Breaking Ground Mini-NUK-PB RTG to the stock PB-NUK RTG,
		// and looking how how much ElectricCharge the stock RTG produces. That actually gives us 0.375 (the Mini-NUK is
		// about half as tall as the stock RTG), but we dropped that to 0.25 to make the math easier.
		ecPerPowerUnit = 0.25

		// The maximum number of Power Units that the converter can provide.
		// Note that this is an integer value. The default is 10.
		// Multiply by ecPerPowerUnit to calculate how much ElectricCharge/sec that the power converter will consume.
		// If you leave focus on the vessel and come back, then the E.C. will be drained accordingly.
