	// Like all parts, kerbals default to max pressure of 4000 kPa, which equates to a maximum diving depth of 400m on Kerbin.
	// This update will put them more in line with real-world diving, which is ~30m for recreational diving, and 100m for technical diving. 
	// The record for the deepest SCUBA dive is 332m, set in 2014 by Ahmed Gabr.
	// Since KSP makes kerbals poof at 50m without a helmet, we'll give them a bit more diving depth with the helmet on.
	// If the kerbal is wearing one of the SunkWorks diving suits, then the max depth increases.
