// The Vintage, Standard, and Future suits are all defined in separate part modules that are combined when KSP starts.
// The problem is that when Module Manager is used to add part modules to the kerbal, you'll get duplicates.
// To get around that problem, the WBIPartModuleUtils adds a custom LoadingSystem that adds any part modules defined by a
// KERBAL_EVA_MODULES node.
