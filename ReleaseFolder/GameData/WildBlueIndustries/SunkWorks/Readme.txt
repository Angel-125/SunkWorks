Changes

- Synchronized the control state of all dive computers on the same vessel, allowing players to control the dive from any computer on the boat.
- Increased resource consumption and Electric Charge output on the stock fuel cell and fuel cell array.

New Parts

- SW-40 "Ebb Tide" Aquatic Engine: This radially attached aquatic engine propels submarines underwater and offers pitch control.
- SW-160 "Neap Tide" Aquatic Engine: This Size 1 aquatic engine propels submarines underwater.
- SW-320 "Low Tide" Aquatic Engine: This Size 2 aquatic engine propels submarines underwater.

Note: A single Fuel Cell Array is sufficient to power 4 SW-40s or 1 SW-160. You'll need two Fuel Cell Arrays to power a single SW-320.
